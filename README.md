# Philadelphia Household Travel Survey Project Evaluation

## Overview

This repository contains the analysis, evaluation, and documentation of the 2012 Philadelphia Household Travel Survey, under the direction of the University of Pennsylvania and Erick Guerra. The project is centered around employing and understanding project evaluation methods, with a significant focus on conducting a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) of a proposed road project in the Philadelphia region. This analysis leverages extensive travel survey data to evaluate economic impacts, travel behavior, and mode choices within the household context of Philadelphia.

## Project Structure

- `Philadelphia Household Travel Survey Project Evaluation.R`: R script containing the code for data analysis and CBA calculation.
- `Philadelphia Household Travel Survey Project Evaluation.docx`: A comprehensive document detailing the project's purpose, methodology, and initial findings.
- `Philadelphia Household Travel Survey Project Evaluation.pdf`: The detailed report of findings, including cost-benefit analysis, NPV calculations, and evaluation of unquantifiable impacts.
- `average_hourly_wage_per_household.csv`: Data file used for calculating the average hourly wage per household, integral to the project's economic analysis.
- `2.1 CBA lectures.xlsx`: Reference material that provides additional context and support for the CBA exercise and project evaluation.
- `Data Dictionary - DVRPC_HTS_Data_Dictionary.xlsx`: A crucial guide to understanding the survey data fields and variables.
- `no_trip_reasons_percentage.csv` and `output_characteristics.csv`: Coding output files for double check. 
- `Data`:
  - `1_Household_Public.csv`: Household data extracted from the 2012 survey.
  - `2_Person_Public.csv`: Individual person data detailing demographics, travel patterns, and other relevant information from the survey.
  - `3_Vehicle_Public.csv`: Data concerning vehicles owned by the surveyed households.
  - `4_Trip_Public.csv`: Detailed trip data, capturing travel modes, durations, and purposes for the survey participants.

## Project Objectives

- To engage with and deepen the understanding of project evaluation methodologies, particularly focusing on CBA within the context of urban planning.
- To calculate the economic NPV of a proposed road project over a 30-year span, adjusting for various discount rates and analyzing shifts in evaluation.
- To assess the broader, often unquantifiable impacts of the road project, including social and environmental considerations.
- To utilize the 2012 Philadelphia household travel survey to estimate travel times and modes, emphasizing cycling and other non-motorized forms of transport.
- To contribute to the discourse on urban infrastructure projects, weighing economic benefits against potential social costs and community impacts.

## Key Findings

- A positive NPV at both considered discount rates (0.04 and 0.06), suggesting economic viability over the long term.
- Significant unquantifiable impacts that could affect community cohesion, environmental quality, and social equity, underscoring the need for a holistic project evaluation approach.
- The essential role of cycling and non-motorized travel modes in urban mobility, highlighted by specific travel time analyses.
- Insights into household economic status through the estimation of average hourly wages, providing a nuanced understanding of the socio-economic landscape.
